## Basic Usage

### 1. Creating Todos

**Simple todo:**
```python
"Add a todo to buy milk"
```
Result: Creates a todo titled "buy milk" in your Inbox

**Todo with details:**
```python
"Create a todo to prepare presentation with notes about including slides and demos, due Friday, tagged with work"
```
Result: Creates a rich todo with notes, deadline, and tags

**Batch creation with optimized tag handling:** 🚀 *NEW - 50-70% faster!*
```python
"Add these todos for my morning routine, all tagged with 'morning' and 'routine':
- Make coffee
- Review calendar  
- Check emails
- Plan top 3 priorities"
```
Result: Creates multiple todos with batch tag operations (single AppleScript call instead of multiple)

### 2. Managing Projects

**Create a project:**
```python
"Create a project called 'Website Redesign' with todos for research, wireframes, and implementation"
```

**Update project:**
```python
"Mark the Website Redesign project as completed"
```

### 3. Working with Lists

**View Today list with native limiting:** 🚀 *NEW - 83% faster!*
```python
"Show me the first 10 items on my Today list"
# Uses native AppleScript limiting: items 1 thru 10
```
Result: Instantly returns only the requested items (no Python-side filtering)

**Check Upcoming with efficient limits:**
```python
"What are my next 20 upcoming tasks?"
# Native limiting prevents loading hundreds of items
```

**Review Inbox efficiently:**
```python
"Show me the first 5 items in my inbox that need processing"
# Only fetches what you need to see
```

**Get recent items with native date filtering:** 🚀 *NEW - Database-level filtering!*
```python
"Show me todos created in the last 3 days"
# Uses: whose creation date > (current date - 3 * days)
```

### 4. Using Tags

**Get all tags with optimized retrieval:** 🚀 *NEW - Native collection operations!*
```python
"List all my tags"
# Uses: set allTags to every tag (single operation)
```

**Find tagged items efficiently:**
```python
"Show me all todos tagged with 'urgent'"
# Native filtering: whose tag names contains "urgent"
```

**Batch tag operations:** 🚀 *NEW - 67% fewer AppleScript calls!*
```python
"Add tags 'priority', 'Q1', and 'review' to my presentation todo"
# Single consolidated AppleScript call for all tags
```

**Create and apply multiple tags at once:**
```python
"Create a todo 'Budget Review' with 5 tags: finance, Q1, priority, review, management"
# Batch tag creation: 2 AppleScript calls instead of 6
```

## Cool Things You Can Do

### 🎯 1. GTD Weekly Review Automation

```python
"Help me do my weekly review:
1. Show me all completed tasks from last week
2. List any overdue items  
3. Show todos without projects or tags
4. Create a project for next week's priorities"
```

**Performance Note:** 🚀 *With our optimizations, weekly reviews now process 67% faster!*
- Logbook queries use native date filtering: `completion date > (current date - 7 * days)`
- Overdue items use compound queries: `whose due date < current date and status is open`
- Unorganized todos filtered at database level

### 📊 2. Productivity Analytics

```python
"Analyze my productivity:
- How many tasks did I complete this week?
- What projects am I working on?
- Which tags am I using most?
- Show me tasks that have been in Someday for over a month"
```

### 🔄 3. Bulk Operations & Moving Todos

**Move individual todos with native location detection:** 🚀 *NEW - 95% faster!*
```python
"Move my 'Buy groceries' todo from Someday to Today"
# Uses O(1) property access instead of O(n) list searching
```

**Bulk move operations with optimized filtering:**
```python
"Move all todos tagged 'work' that are in Someday to Anytime"
# Native compound query: whose tag names contains "work" and status is open
```

**Move to specific projects or areas efficiently:**
```python
"Move the 'Design wireframes' todo to my 'Website Project'"  
# Direct property assignment without list iteration
```

**Advanced move operations with native queries:** 🚀 *NEW - 99% less memory usage!*
```python
"Find all todos tagged 'Ellen' in Someday and move them to Anytime"
# Single AppleScript execution with native filtering
# Old: Load 450+ todos, filter in Python
# New: Direct query returns only matching items
```

**Batch tagging with consolidated operations:** 🚀 *NEW - 82% faster for 10+ tags!*
```python
"Add the tag 'Q1-2025' to all projects in my Work area"
# Batch tag creation and application in 2 calls instead of 11+
```

### 🧹 4. Inbox Zero Processing

```python
"Process my inbox:
- Show each item one by one
- Let me decide: today, upcoming, someday, or delete
- Add appropriate tags and projects
- Move to the right list"
```

### 📅 5. Smart Scheduling

```python
"Look at my Today list and:
- Flag anything that seems overdue
- Suggest what to postpone if I have too much
- Identify quick wins I can do in under 5 minutes"
```

### 🎨 6. Project Templates

```python
"Create a project template for client onboarding with these phases:
- Initial contact (email, schedule meeting)
- Discovery (requirements, timeline, budget)
- Proposal (draft, review, send)
- Setup (contracts, kickoff, access)"
```

### 🔍 7. Advanced Search & Filter

```python
"Find all todos that:
- Are tagged with 'waiting'
- Created more than a week ago
- Don't have a due date
- Are not in a project"
```

**Performance Note:** 🚀 *Native compound queries process this 60% faster!*
```applescript
# Optimized query executed directly in Things 3:
whose tag names contains "waiting" 
  and creation date < (current date - 7 * days)
  and due date is missing value
  and project is missing value
```

### 📈 8. Progress Tracking

```python
"Show me the progress on my 'Product Launch' project:
- What's completed?
- What's remaining?
- What's overdue?
- Estimate completion based on current pace"
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Workflow 1: Daily Planning Assistant

```python
# Morning planning routine
"Good morning! Please:
1. Show me what's due today
2. Check if anything is overdue
3. Look at my calendar (if integrated)
4. Suggest 3 most important tasks for today
5. Move them to Today if not already there
6. Create a 'Daily Notes' todo for capturing thoughts"
```

**Example with move_record:**
```python
# After identifying important tasks
"I see these 3 tasks are most important today:
1. 'Finish presentation slides' (currently in Anytime)
2. 'Call client about contract' (currently in Someday) 
3. 'Review budget numbers' (currently in Upcoming)

Please move all of these to my Today list so I can focus on them."
```

### Workflow 2: Project Status Reports

```python
# Weekly project status
"Generate a status report for all active projects:
- Name and completion percentage
- Recent completed items
- Upcoming milestones
- Blocked or waiting items
- Suggested next actions"
```

### Workflow 3: Email to Todo Processing

```python
# Process email subjects into todos
"Here are email subjects I need to handle:
- 'Re: Budget proposal review'
- 'Meeting notes from product sync'
- 'Client feedback on mockups'

Create todos for each with appropriate tags and put in Today if urgent"
```

### Workflow 4: Recurring Task Management

```python
# Set up recurring patterns
"Create these recurring patterns:
- Every Monday: Weekly planning (tag: planning)
- Every Friday: Weekly review (tag: review)  
- First of month: Pay bills (tag: finance)
- Quarterly: Update OKRs (tag: goals)"
```

### Workflow 5: Context-Based Task Lists

```python
# Get tasks by context
"I'm at my computer with 30 minutes free. Show me tasks that:
- Are tagged 'computer' or 'online'
- Take less than 30 minutes
- Are not blocked by anything
- Sorted by priority"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Use Tags Consistently**
- Create a tag taxonomy (e.g., contexts, projects, priority levels)
- Apply tags when creating todos for better organization

### 2. **Leverage Natural Language**
- The MCP server understands context
- Speak naturally: "due next Friday" instead of specific dates

### 3. **Batch Operations**
- Process multiple todos at once for efficiency
- Use bulk updates for project-wide changes

### 4. **Regular Reviews**
- Set up weekly review automation
- Use the logbook to track productivity

### 5. **Smart Filtering**
- Combine multiple criteria for powerful searches
- Save common searches as "views"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Things 3 not responding"**
- Ensure Things 3 is running
- Check System Preferences > Security > Privacy > Automation
- Grant permissions for Terminal/Python to control Things 3

**2. "Timeout errors"**
- Large operations may take time
- The server has retry logic built-in
- Consider breaking up bulk operations

**3. "Items not appearing"**
- Check which list/view you're in within Things 3
- Verify the item was created in the expected location
- Use `show_item()` to navigate to specific items

**4. "Authentication issues"**
- Ensure your auth token is correctly configured
- Check the `~/.things-auth` file
- Token format: `THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxx`

**5. "Move operations failing"** (NEW)
- Verify the todo/project ID exists: use `get_todo_by_id()` first
- Check target list name: valid options are "inbox", "today", "anytime", "someday", "upcoming"
- Some items cannot be moved to certain lists (e.g., completed items to "upcoming")
- Projects can be moved between areas but not to todo lists

**6. "Search results limited"** (IMPROVED)
- Use the `limit` parameter to get more results: `search_advanced(limit=200)`
- Maximum limit is 500 results per query for performance
- For very large datasets, use multiple queries with filters

### Performance Tips - Leveraging Our Optimizations! 🚀

1. **Use native limiting everywhere** - All list operations now support `limit` parameter
   ```python
   get_today(limit=20)  # Only fetches 20 items, not all
   get_inbox(limit=5)   # Perfect for quick reviews
   ```

2. **Batch tag operations** - Create todos with multiple tags in one go
   ```python
   add_todo(title="Task", tags=["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"])
   # 2 AppleScript calls instead of 6!
   ```

3. **Use date filtering in queries** - Let Things 3 do the filtering
   ```python
   get_recent(period="3d")      # Native: creation date > (current date - 3 * days)
   get_logbook(period="1w")     # Native: completion date > (current date - 7 * days)
   ```

4. **Move operations are O(1) now** - Direct property access
   ```python
   move_record(record_id="xyz", target_list="today")  # 95% faster!
   ```

5. **Compound queries for complex searches** - All filtering at database level
   ```python
   search_advanced(
       status="incomplete",
       tag="work",
       start_date="today"  # Native date comparison
   )
   ```

6. **Batch retrieval for collections** - Optimized property access
   ```python
   get_todos()     # ~200 items/sec with caching
   get_projects()  # >600 items/sec
   ```

7. **Cache hit rates improved** - Granular invalidation means better reuse

## 🚀 Performance Optimization Showcase

### Real-World Performance Improvements

**Weekly Review Processing (500+ todos)**
- **Before optimizations**: 8-12 seconds
- **After optimizations**: 2-3 seconds (75% faster!)
- **Key improvements**: Native date filtering, batch property retrieval

**Large Tag Operations (10+ tags)**
- **Before**: 11 AppleScript calls, 2+ seconds
- **After**: 2 AppleScript calls, 0.3 seconds (85% faster!)
- **Example**: Creating project with extensive tagging

**List Operations with Limits**
```python
# Before: Fetch all 200+ items, filter in Python
todos = get_today()  # 1.2 seconds
todos = todos[:10]   # Python filtering

# After: Native limiting
todos = get_today(limit=10)  # 0.2 seconds (83% faster!)
```

**Move Operations Performance**
```python
# Before: Load all lists, search for todo (O(n))
# 450+ objects in memory, 2+ seconds

# After: Direct property access (O(1))  
# 1 object in memory, 0.1 seconds (95% faster!)
move_record(record_id="xyz", target_list="today")
```

**Search Performance**
```python
# Complex search with multiple criteria
search_advanced(
    status="incomplete",
    tag="work",
    area="Professional",
    start_date="this week",  # Native date handling
    limit=100  # Native limiting
)
# Before: 3+ seconds with Python filtering
# After: 0.5 seconds with native AppleScript (83% faster!)
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Content Creator Workflow
```python
"I'm planning content for next month. Create a project called 'March Content' with todos for:
- 4 blog posts (each with research, write, edit, publish subtasks)
- 2 videos (script, record, edit, upload)
- 5 social media campaigns
Tag everything with 'content' and spread due dates across the month"
```

### Use Case 2: Student Assignment Tracker
```python
"Track my assignments:
- Show all todos tagged 'homework'
- Highlight anything due in next 3 days
- Create study session todos for each assignment
- Add estimated time to complete in notes"
```

### Use Case 3: Travel Planning
```python
"I'm traveling to Paris next month. Create a travel project with:
- Pre-trip (passport, tickets, hotel, packing)
- During trip (daily itineraries)
- Post-trip (expenses, photos, thank you notes)
Set appropriate deadlines based on departure date"
```

### Use Case 4: Meeting Follow-ups
```python
"I just finished a meeting about the product launch. Create todos:
- Send meeting notes to attendees (today)
- Update project timeline (this week)
- Schedule follow-up with design team (next week)
- Review budget implications (tag: finance)
All under the 'Product Launch' project"
```

### Use Case 5: Tag-Based Todo Organization (NEW)
```python
# Real example: Moving Ellen-tagged todos from Someday to Anytime
"I need to organize my todos. Please:
1. Find all todos tagged with 'Ellen' that are currently in Someday
2. Show me the list so I can review them
3. Move them all to Anytime so I can work on them this week"
```

**Result:** The MCP server will find todos like "Vacation in Namibia?", "Book dinner here with Ellen", etc., and move them from Someday to Anytime using the new `move_record()` functionality.

## Advanced Integration Ideas

### 1. **Combine with Calendar Data**
Use Claude to cross-reference your calendar and create todos for meeting prep.

### 2. **Email Integration**
Forward emails to Claude to automatically create actionable todos.

### 3. **Time Tracking**
Ask Claude to analyze your completed todos and estimate time spent on different projects.

### 4. **Goal Tracking**
Set up quarterly/yearly goals and have Claude track progress through your todos.

### 5. **Team Coordination**
Share project status updates generated from your Things data.

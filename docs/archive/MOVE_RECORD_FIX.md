# Move Record Fix Documentation

## Problem
The `move_record` functionality in the Things MCP server was reported as not working for moving todos to projects. Users could create todos in the inbox but couldn't move them to projects using the MCP interface.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Discovery 1: Implementation Already Existed
The codebase already had sophisticated move functionality in `move_operations.py` that supported:
- Moving to built-in lists (inbox, today, anytime, someday, upcoming, logbook)
- Moving to projects using format `"project:PROJECT_ID"`
- Moving to areas using format `"area:AREA_ID"`

The issue was that this functionality was implemented but had bugs preventing it from working correctly.

### Discovery 2: AppleScript `move` Command Limitation
Through testing, we discovered that Things 3's AppleScript `move` command **does not work** for moving todos to projects or areas. The command only works for built-in lists.

**What doesn't work:**
```applescript
move theTodo to targetProject  -- FAILS with "Cannot move to-do"
```

**What does work:**
```applescript
set project of theTodo to targetProject  -- SUCCESS!
```

### Discovery 3: AppleScript Syntax Issues
The original `move_operations.py` had several AppleScript syntax errors:
1. Reserved word conflicts with `project` and `area` 
2. Complex list checking syntax that failed to compile
3. Incorrect `tell` block syntax for list operations

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed AppleScript Move Commands
Updated `move_operations.py` to use property assignment instead of move command:

```python
# For projects (line 572)
set project of theTodo to targetProject

# For areas (line 598)
set area of theTodo to targetArea
```

### 2. Simplified AppleScript Syntax
Removed complex list checking logic that caused syntax errors and simplified the `getCurrentLocation` function to avoid compilation issues.

### 3. Fixed Parsing Issues
Replaced missing `_parse_applescript_record` method with simple string parsing to handle the AppleScript output.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/things_mcp/move_operations.py`**
   - Changed project/area move from `move` command to property assignment
   - Simplified `getCurrentLocation` function to avoid syntax errors
   - Fixed parsing of AppleScript output

## Testing Results

✅ **Successfully tested all move operations:**
- Moving todos to projects: `move_record("todo_id", "project:PROJECT_ID")`
- Moving todos to areas: `move_record("todo_id", "area:AREA_ID")`
- Moving todos to lists: `move_record("todo_id", "inbox")` (etc.)

## Usage Examples

```python
# Move to project
await tools.move_record(
    todo_id="ABC123",
    destination_list="project:2KC2YtbD1gKUCwo2aGoqqS"
)

# Move to area
await tools.move_record(
    todo_id="ABC123",
    destination_list="area:XYZ789"
)

# Move to list (backward compatible)
await tools.move_record(
    todo_id="ABC123",
    destination_list="inbox"
)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Things 3 AppleScript Limitations**: The `move` command in Things 3 AppleScript only works for built-in lists, not for projects or areas. Must use property assignment instead.

2. **AppleScript Reserved Words**: Words like `project` and `area` are properties in Things 3 AppleScript and need careful handling to avoid syntax errors.

3. **Testing is Critical**: Direct testing with Things 3 was essential to discover the actual AppleScript behavior, which differed from documentation.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully maintained** - All existing move operations to lists continue to work exactly as before. The fix only enhances functionality to support projects and areas.

## Related Issues Fixed

1. **AppleScript syntax errors**: Fixed multiple syntax issues in complex list detection code
2. **Missing method error**: Fixed `_parse_applescript_record` method not found error
3. **Property access errors**: Fixed issues with accessing `project` and `area` properties

## Verification

The fix has been verified with:
- Direct AppleScript testing
- Integration testing with real Things 3 operations
- Multiple test scenarios including create, move to project, move back to inbox, and cleanup

All tests pass successfully with the implemented changes.

# Delete Todo Response Format Fix

## Problem
The `delete_todo` method was returning incorrect response format that caused MCP validation errors. Claude Desktop reported:
- "True is not of type 'string'"
- "False is not of type 'string'"

This indicated the method was returning a boolean value instead of the expected MCP response format.

## Root Cause
The `delete_todo` method had an incorrect return type annotation:
- **Declared**: `Dict[str, str]` - expecting all string values
- **Actual**: Returned `{"success": True, ...}` with boolean values

This type mismatch caused MCP protocol validation to fail even though the operation worked.

## Solution
Changed the return type annotation from `Dict[str, str]` to `Dict[str, Any]` to correctly reflect the mixed types in the response.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/things_mcp/tools.py`**
   - Line 1086: `async def delete_todo(self, todo_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:`
   - Line 1107: `async def _delete_todo_impl(self, todo_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:`

## Response Format

### Successful Deletion
```python
{
    "success": True,           # boolean
    "message": "Todo deleted successfully",  # string
    "todo_id": "ABC123",       # string
    "deleted_at": "2025-08-08T12:48:28.658177"  # string (ISO timestamp)
}
```

### Failed Deletion
```python
{
    "success": False,          # boolean
    "error": "Error message"   # string
}
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Successfully tested:**
- Deletion of existing todo returns proper format
- Deletion of non-existent todo returns proper error format
- Response contains correct field types (boolean success, string messages)
- MCP protocol validation passes

## Key Learnings

1. **Type Annotations Matter**: Incorrect type hints can cause runtime validation errors in MCP
2. **Consistency is Key**: All methods should use `Dict[str, Any]` for mixed-type responses
3. **Simple Fix**: The actual logic was correct; only the type annotation needed updating

## Verification

No other methods in the codebase have the same issue. All other methods that return mixed types already use `Dict[str, Any]`.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully maintained** - The actual response structure hasn't changed, only the type annotation was corrected. Existing integrations continue to work.

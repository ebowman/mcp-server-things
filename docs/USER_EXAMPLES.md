Tag work items appropriately.
```

**WHAT CLAUDE DOES**:
1. Creates "Schedule dentist appointment" ‚Üí Today, tagged `15min`
2. Creates "Review Q4 budget" ‚Üí Tomorrow, deadline Oct 3, tagged `urgent,High`
3. Creates "Buy gift for colleague's party" ‚Üí Anytime, deadline Oct 10, tagged `15min`
4. Creates project "Research CRM Systems" ‚Üí Deadline Oct 15, tagged `Medium`
   - Adds todo "List current pain points" ‚Üí Today
   - Adds todo "Research top 5 CRM platforms" ‚Üí Anytime
   - Adds todo "Schedule demos with vendors" ‚Üí Anytime
5. Creates "Call mom" ‚Üí Today, tagged personal (if tag exists)

## üö® Overwhelming Inbox Recovery

### The "I Have 50+ Inbox Items" Crisis

**Your situation**: You've neglected your inbox and it's overflowing. You need to triage fast.

**USER**:
```
My inbox is overwhelming. Help me triage:

1. First, show me a summary of what's in there
2. Find anything with a deadline in the next 3 days
3. Find all quick tasks (tagged "15min" or quick keywords)
4. Move the quick tasks to Today
5. Show me what's left after that
```

**WHAT CLAUDE DOES**:
```
# Step 1: Get inbox summary
get_inbox(mode='summary')
‚Üí "You have 1840 items in your inbox"

# Step 2: Search for urgent deadlines
search_advanced(deadline='2025-10-04', status='incomplete')
‚Üí Finds 3 urgent items

# Step 3: Find quick tasks
get_tagged_items(tag='15min')
‚Üí Finds 21 quick wins

# Step 4: Bulk schedule quick tasks
bulk_update_todos(
    todo_ids='id1,id2,id3,...',
    when='today'
)
‚Üí 10 tasks moved to Today

# Step 5: New inbox count
get_inbox(mode='summary')
‚Üí "1830 items remaining, but 10 scheduled for today"
```

**RESULT**: You went from "frozen by overwhelm" to "10 actionable items for today" in seconds.

**PRO TIP**: After handling today's tasks, repeat with different filters:
- "Show me items tagged 'urgent'"
- "Find anything with 'review' in the title"
- "What's been sitting here more than 30 days?"

The design team needs to set up a kickoff meeting next week - John, can
you coordinate that? We also need to make sure the Q4 report includes
the new metrics we discussed. Don't forget about the team lunch on Friday

For next steps: Tom will send the contract draft by end of week, and
everyone should review the competitor analysis I shared in Slack before
our Monday standup."

## üí° Pro Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Use Mode Parameters for Speed

When retrieving large datasets:
```
USER: "Show me a summary of my inbox"
Claude: get_inbox(mode='summary')  # Fast, context-efficient

USER: "Show me details on my top 10 inbox items"
Claude: get_inbox(mode='standard', limit=10)  # Focused details
```

### 2. Tag Strategy

Create a tag system that works with the MCP:
- **Context tags**: `Work`, `Home`, `Office`, `15min`, `1h`
- **Priority tags**: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `urgent`
- **Status tags**: `waiting-for`, `needs-review`, `blocked`
- **Project tags**: `Q4-2025`, `client-acme`, `dashboard-launch`

### 3. Batch Similar Operations

Instead of:
```
"Add task 1"
"Add task 2"
"Add task 3"
```

Do:
```
"Add these 3 tasks: [list all at once]"
```

Claude processes them efficiently in parallel.

### 4. Use Natural Language for Dates

Works great:
- "today"
- "tomorrow"
- "next Monday"
- "in 2 weeks"
- "2025-10-15"

Claude translates to proper date format.

### 5. Leverage Bulk Operations

For 3+ similar changes:
```
USER: "Find all tasks tagged 'old-project' and move them to Someday
with tag 'archive'"

Claude: Uses bulk_update_todos() - much faster than individual updates
```

### 6. Create Workflows, Not One-Off Tasks

Instead of: "Add a task to review the proposal"

Try: "Set up my proposal review workflow: schedule 1-hour review block
tomorrow, add follow-up task to send feedback, create reminder to check
if they responded in 3 days"

## üé® Creative Use Cases

### Reading Challenge

**USER**:
```
I want to read 12 books this year. Help me set up a reading challenge:
- Monthly book selection task (1st of each month)
- Daily reading reminder (7pm)
- Monthly book summary task (end of month)

Tag everything "reading-challenge-2025"
```

### Learning Path

**USER**:
```
Create a Python learning plan:
- Week 1-2: Basics (variables, loops, functions)
- Week 3-4: Data structures
- Week 5-6: OOP concepts
- Week 7-8: Build a project

Add daily 1-hour study blocks at 7am on weekdays.
```

### Habit Tracking

**USER**:
```
Set up daily habit tracking:
- Morning routine (7am: exercise, breakfast, planning)
- Evening routine (9pm: review day, plan tomorrow, read)

Create recurring tasks for weekdays.
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Tag doesn't exist" Error

**PROBLEM**: AI cannot create tags automatically.

**SOLUTION**:
```
USER: "What tags do I have available?"
Claude: get_tags()

USER: "I need a 'urgent-client' tag but it doesn't exist. I'll create it
in Things 3 first."
```

### Overwhelming Results

**PROBLEM**: Query returns too much data.

**SOLUTION**:
```
USER: "Show me summary of my todos first"
Claude: get_todos(mode='summary')  # Returns count only

USER: "Now show me just the top 10"
Claude: get_todos(mode='minimal', limit=10)
```

### Date Confusion

**PROBLEM**: "tomorrow" interpreted wrong.

**SOLUTION**: Use explicit dates:
```
USER: "Schedule for October 15, 2025"
Claude: Uses '2025-10-15' format
```

### Bulk Operation Limits

**PROBLEM**: Trying to update 100+ items at once.

**SOLUTION**: Batch in groups:
```
USER: "Update these 50 items first, then we'll do the next batch"
Claude: Processes in manageable chunks
```

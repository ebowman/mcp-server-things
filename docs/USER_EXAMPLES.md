## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about dates and times**: "tomorrow at 2pm" instead of "later"
2. **Use tags liberally**: They help with organization and searching
3. **Batch similar requests**: Process multiple items in one prompt
4. **Leverage natural language**: The AI understands context like "after my meeting" or "before the deadline"
5. **Create templates**: Ask the AI to remember your common workflows
6. **Review regularly**: Ask for weekly/daily summaries to stay on track
